#### Build and deployment notes:

_vxa-node_ now includes the source code for the _Vision_ libraries upon which it depends with those libraries - _V_, _Vca_, _Vsa_, _Vxa_ and _VcaMain_ - now built automatically by _node-gyp_ on _linux_, _Apple Os X_ (the _Mac_), and _Windows_.  A locally installed copy of _Open Source Vision_ (_osv_) is no longer required to use this module with _node_.
